This work aims at reproducing the results from Satoshi Takeuchi in the paper "Dynamics of particles accelerated by head-on collisions of two magnetized
plasma shocks".

The relativistic Boris-Pusher algorithm is in modules/functions.py and the main code is in scripts/test_particle_approach.py. 

A dedicated file for data plotting can be found in modules/data_plotting.py
